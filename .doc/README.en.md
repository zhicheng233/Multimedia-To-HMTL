Converting multimedia files to Html files for some special needs

## Why write this

Someone in the class wanted to use a tablet to look at pictures, and the controls on the stupid tablet at school could only open txt and html files via a USB stick, so I researched it and came up with this project

## Tutorial on how to use it
* Put the images you want to convert into a folder and make sure the names match the specification
* Open the program and select the conversion mode
* Enter the path
* Wait for the conversion to complete

## Caution (must read)
* This project is for learning and communication purposes only, it should not be used for profit or commercial purposes, and this project should not be distributed publicly.
* The default export path is the running directory
* Can't convert jpg and png at the same time, the default format is the more popular format, please make sure the format is uniform before conversion (actually it is possible but too lazy to write)
* Please use Python 3.10+ to run

## Tweets
Android's file management is really dumb, you can't access the content with the "file:///" protocol no matter how you write it
